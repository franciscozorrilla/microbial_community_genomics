# Genome Mining

## Preface

Hands-on material to run different genome mining approaches in python for the lecture "Gene annotation; a key step in integrating omics methods" as part of the the course "Multi-omics analyses of the microbial community" at Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU). 

## Repository content

To keep it easy, we just link here:

- a [basic introduction to python](./introduction_to_python.ipynb) including variables, statements and basic plotting for dataframes. 
- a [main jupyter notebook](./hands_on_genome_mining.ipynb) with all the self-contained code to run the different analyses. 
- a [data folder](./data) with basic example files to avoid large computation (it is a bit messy, sorry! be better than me organizing your directories!) 

Still, this material is complementary to theoretical content included in [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iad5MKHSTRdqDJgdIiTemxh5WUb9z7kTxrSJEfBV_tU/edit?usp=sharing).

In some cases, I have taken inspiration or even examples from very clever people in the field, in those cases, the links and references will be present in the respective sections of the notebooks.
