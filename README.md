# Genome Mining

## Preface

Hands-on material to run different genome mining approaches in python for the lecture "Gene annotation; a key step in integrating omics methods" as part of the the course "Multi-omics analyses of the microbial community" at Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU). 

## Repository content

To keep it easy, we just link here:

- a basic introduction to python including variables, statements and basic plotting. 
- a main jupyter notebook with all the self-contained code to run the different analyses. 
- a data folder with basic example files to avoid large computation. 

Still, this material is complementary to theoretical content included in [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iad5MKHSTRdqDJgdIiTemxh5WUb9z7kTxrSJEfBV_tU/edit?usp=sharing).
