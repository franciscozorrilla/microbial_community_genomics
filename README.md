# 🧬 Microbial Community Genomics 💻

Teaching materials for the **Sunagawa Lab Block Course Fall 2025: 551-1119-00L Microbial Community Genomics** at ETH Zürich. Instructed by [Samuel Miravet-Verde](https://github.com/samuelmiver), [Martin Sperfeld](https://github.com/martsper), and [Francisco Zorrilla](https://github.com/franciscozorrilla).

## 📰 About

This repo has been forked from hands-on material related to genome mining approaches compiled by [Samuel Miravet-Verde](https://github.com/samuelmiver), associated with [the lecture](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iad5MKHSTRdqDJgdIiTemxh5WUb9z7kTxrSJEfBV_tU/edit?usp=sharing) *Gene annotation; a key step in integrating omics methods* delivered as part of the the course *Multi-omics analyses of the microbial community* at Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU).

## 🧰 Contents

There are three main components in this repo:

1. [Basic introduction to python](./introduction_to_python.ipynb) including variables, statements and basic plotting for dataframes. 
2. [Main jupyter notebook](./hands_on_genome_mining.ipynb) with self-contained code to run the different analyses. 
3. [Data folder](./data) with basic example files to avoid large computation.
